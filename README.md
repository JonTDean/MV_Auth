# API Auth for Single Page Applications

## Session-Based Auth vs Token-Based Auth

In the video below, I discuss two approaches to auth working with separate frontend and backend applications, and some pros and cons of each approach. After watching this, you can decide to go to the [Session-Based Auth](#session-based-auth) section or [Token-Based Auth](#token-based-auth) section in this readme based on what you'd like to implement in your application.

## Token-Based Auth

Completed code for this section is in `token-auth-client` and `token-auth-server`. You'll also find more notes in the [TOKEN.md](TOKEN.md) readme.
